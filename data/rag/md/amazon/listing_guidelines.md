# Amazon Listing Guidelines (Fashion & Lifestyle Focus)

These simplified guidelines are inspired by public Amazon policies and best practices.
They are intentionally structured so that sections and headings can be retrieved
independently by a RAG system.

---

## 1. General Principles

- Product listings must be **accurate, honest, and not misleading**.
- The product detail page should represent **one specific product or product family**.
- Information shown to customers (titles, bullets, images, price, attributes) must match:
  - what is shipped,
  - what is invoiced,
  - and what is described in packaging.

Violations can lead to:

- Listing suppression,
- Buy Box loss,
- or account-level warnings and suspensions.

## 2. Titles

### 2.1 Title Structure

For fashion and footwear, a recommended structure is:

> **Brand + Product Type + Key Attribute + Fit/Variant + Color**

Examples:

- `BrandA Men's Running Shoes Mesh Lightweight - Blue`
- `BrandB Men's Slim Fit Formal Shirt – White`
- `BrandD Women's Silk Blend Saree with Zari Work – Red`

### 2.2 Title Do’s

- Include:
  - Brand name,
  - Product type (e.g., “Running Shoes”, “Formal Shirt”, “Kurti”, “Saree”),
  - 1–2 key attributes (material, fit, occasion),
  - Color or pattern.
- Keep titles **clear and scannable**:
  - Use normal capitalization (Title Case, not ALL CAPS),
  - Avoid unnecessary punctuation.
- Stay within **200 characters** for better readability and compatibility.

### 2.3 Title Don’ts

- Do **NOT** use ALL CAPS for the entire title.
- Do **NOT** include:
  - Promotional phrases: “Best Deal”, “No.1 Seller”, “Limited Offer”.
  - Shipping claims: “Free Shipping”, “Fastest Delivery”.
  - Subjective adjectives only: “Amazing”, “Top Quality” without substance.
- Do **NOT** stuff irrelevant keywords or competitor brand names into titles.
- Do **NOT** include price, discount percentage, or coupon codes in the title.

## 3. Bullet Points (Key Product Features)

### 3.1 Recommended Number and Style

- Provide **3–5 bullet points**.
- Each bullet should cover **one clear aspect**:
  - material & construction,
  - comfort & fit,
  - use-case or occasion,
  - care instructions,
  - special features.

### 3.2 Bullet Content Guidelines

- Use sentence fragments rather than long paragraphs.
  - Example: `Soft breathable cotton; ideal for all-day office wear.`
- Start with a **strong keyword or benefit**:
  - `COMFORTABLE FIT: ...`
  - `PREMIUM FABRIC: ...`
- Focus on **benefits tied to facts**:
  - `Mesh upper for better ventilation during runs`
  - `Stretchable cotton-spandex for comfortable movement`

### 3.3 Bullet Don’ts

- Do **NOT** include:
  - Prices or discounts,
  - Shipping promises,
  - Competing marketplace names or links.
- Avoid **ALL CAPS** walls of text.
- Avoid repeating the **same keyword unnaturally** in each bullet.
- Do not copy exact competitor content.

## 4. Product Description

### 4.1 Purpose

The description should give the customer:

- A clear story of **when, where, and how** the product is used.
- More detail than bullets can provide.
- Context for size, fabric, styling, and care.

### 4.2 Good Practices

- Write in **simple, customer-friendly language**.
- Explain:
  - fabric feel (soft, sturdy, lightweight),
  - intended use (office, casual, party, running),
  - key design details (collar type, sleeve, border, pattern).
- Include **wash care** where relevant (e.g., sarees, kurtis, denim):
  - `Dry clean only`, `Machine wash cold`, etc.
- Keep paragraphs short (2–4 lines).

### 4.3 Things to Avoid

- Do not make **unsubstantiated claims** such as:
  - “guaranteed to cure back pain”,
  - “miracle slimming effect”.
- Do not include:
  - external URLs,
  - phone numbers,
  - email addresses,
  - references to other marketplaces.

## 5. Keywords & Search Terms (Backend Keywords)

### 5.1 What to Include

- Relevant synonyms:
  - `running shoes`, `sports shoes`, `jogging shoes`
- Common variations:
  - `kurti`, `kurta`, `tunic`
- Use-case keywords:
  - `office wear`, `party wear`, `wedding`, `daily use`.

### 5.2 What to Avoid

- Repeating the same word dozens of times.
- Adding competitor brand names as generic keywords.
- Irrelevant, click-bait terms:
  - adding `iPhone`, `Samsung`, `PS5` to a saree listing to get traffic.

## 7. Prohibited & Risky Practices

### 7.1 Misleading Content

- Misrepresenting material: saying `100% cotton` when it is a blend.
- Stating certifications that you do not have.
- Using images that do not match the actual product color or design.

### 7.2 Keyword & SEO Abuse

- Stuffing the same keyword many times in title and bullets.
- Adding unrelated high-volume queries just for impressions:
  - e.g., adding `iPhone case` or `sports bike` to apparel listings.

### 7.3 Policy Breaches

- Using competitor brand names in a way that confuses customers.
- Referring to reviews or ratings in the title:
  - “5-star rated shirt”, “Top reviewed jacket”.

## 8. Example: Good vs Bad Title

**Bad:**

> `BEST DEAL!!! TOP QUALITY SHOES FREE SHIPPING – AMAZING OFFER LIMITED TIME`

Problems:

- ALL CAPS and excessive punctuation.
- Promotional language.
- No clear brand, type, material, or gender.

**Good:**

> `BrandA Men's Running Shoes Mesh Lightweight – Blue`

- Brand + gender + product type + key material + color.
- No promotions, just descriptive.

## 9. How the Copilot Should Use These Guidelines

When optimizing a listing for Amazon:

1. **Check title** against:
   - structure and length,
   - prohibited phrases (ALL CAPS, “Best Deal”, “Free Shipping”).
2. **Check bullets**:
   - whether key benefits and attributes are present,
   - whether they avoid prices/promotions.
3. **Check description**:
   - avoid health or performance claims that can’t be supported,
   - ensure it matches the attributes (fabric, fit, use-case).
4. **Check category coverage**:
   - footwear: material, sole, usage,
   - ethnic wear: fabric, work, occasion, blouse piece,
   - accessories: capacity, material, feature details.

The agent should then suggest **specific, rule-aware changes** rather than generic advice.
