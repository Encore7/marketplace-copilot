# 2. Title Optimization (Amazon Fashion)

A strong Amazon title should be:

- **Readable**
- **Search-friendly**
- **Policy-compliant**
- **Category-formatted**

## 2.1 General Title Structure (Recommended)

Brand + Product Type + Key Feature + Material/Pattern + Color + Size/Pack (if relevant)

Examples:
- “BrandA Men’s Running Shoes, Lightweight Mesh, Blue”
- “BrandB Women’s Cotton Kurti with Floral Print, Pink”

## 2.2 Do’s
- Include 2–4 most relevant keywords (e.g., “running shoes”, “mesh”, “lightweight”)
- Put the most important term early in the title
- Use clear, non-promotional language
- Follow 150–200 characters maximum (Amazon guideline)

## 2.3 Don’ts (Strict SEO Rules)
- Don’t use ALL CAPS
- Don’t include promotional phrases:  
  - “Best Deal”  
  - “Hot Sale”  
  - “Discount”  
  - “Free Shipping”
- Don’t keyword-stuff
- Don’t include competitor names
- Don’t repeat words unnecessarily

# 3. Bullet Points (Key Product Features)

Amazon recommends using **3–5 concise bullets**.

## 3.1 What to Include
- Fabric/material details (e.g., “Cotton blend”, “Breathable mesh”)
- Fit/cut (regular fit, slim fit)
- Use-case (daily wear, running, gym, office, festive)
- Key technical features (cushioning, stretch fabric, moisture-wicking)
- Care instructions

## 3.2 Formatting Guidelines
- Start each bullet with a **short uppercase phrase**:
  - “LIGHTWEIGHT DESIGN:”  
  - “Soft cushioning for long walks.”
- Use short sentences, not paragraphs
- Avoid vague adjectives (“amazing”, “cool”, “premium”) unless justified

## 3.3 Don’ts
- No guarantees: “guaranteed comfort”, “100% sweat-proof”, etc.
- No unverifiable claims: “increases running speed”
- No medical claims: “cures knee pain”

# 4. Product Description (SEO + Conversion)

Product descriptions should:

- Include secondary keywords  
- Provide styling tips (fashion categories)

## 4.1 Best Practices

- Blend in keywords naturally
- Add details not covered in bullets:  
  - craftsmanship  
  - fabric feel  
  - design inspiration  
  - seasonal suitability
- Explain “why it’s useful for the buyer”

## 4.2 Avoid
- Repeating the title verbatim
- Keyword stuffing
- Technical jargon without explanation
- Claiming certifications unless verified

This field is invisible to customers but important for indexing.

## 5.1 What to include
- Synonyms (“jogging shoes”, “sports shoes”, “mesh sneakers”)
- Long-tail phrases

- Regional keywords (“kolkata saree”, “cotton kurta men”)

## 5.2 Rules
