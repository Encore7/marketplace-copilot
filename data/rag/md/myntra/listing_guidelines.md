# 1. Myntra Listing Philosophy

Myntra prioritizes:

- **Premium visual merchandising**  
- **Detailed attributes**  
- **Authentic materials & construction details**  
- **Consistency between title, images, and attributes**  
- **Maintaining platform reputation for fashion correctness**  

Myntra is not a “budget-first” platform like Meesho; it is a “brand-quality-first” marketplace.
