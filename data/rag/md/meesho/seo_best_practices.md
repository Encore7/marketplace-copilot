Examples of strong searchable phrases:

- “casual shirt for office”  
- “lightweight sports shoes”  

Avoid:
- vague adjectives (“superb”, “amazing”)  
- non-searchable fluff  
- overuse of fabric terms

# 4. Attribute Optimization (Most Important SEO Factor)

Meesho ranks sellers higher when attributes are fully filled.

## 4.1 Apparel Attributes
- Fabric (cotton blend, rayon)  
- Fit type  
- Pattern  
- Length  
- Sleeve style  
- Neck type  
- Occasion  
- Color  

## 4.2 Footwear Attributes

# 5. Keyword Strategy for Meesho

Use:
- product type keywords  
- material + pattern  
- use-case terms (daily wear, office wear, casual wear)  
- category-specific descriptors (A-line, straight-cut, ankle-length)  

Avoid:
- trending but irrelevant keywords  
- branded keywords  
- misleading performance claims  

---

# 6. Image SEO Guidelines

Search ranking improves when:
- minimum 3–4 images are present  
- images match product descriptions  
- color variations are visible  
- product is shown clearly without distractions  

Low-quality images → increased bounce + returns → SEO penalty.

# 7. How Copilot Should Use This

The copilot should:

1. Rewrite titles for clarity + keyword relevance  
2. Insert relevant use-case terms in description  
3. Optimize attributes for maximum completeness  
4. Suggest missing high-impact keywords  
5. Ensure consistency across title → bullets → attributes → images  
6. Flag keyword stuffing or irrelevant terms  
7. Generate clean, factual bullets with proper material/pattern keywords  

This gives Meesho listings the highest probability of ranking well.
