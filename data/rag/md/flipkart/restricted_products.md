# 7. How the Copilot Should Use This

When checking Flipkart compliance:

1. Identify risky claims in title/bullets/description.  
2. Match terms against the restricted keyword lists.  
3. Validate that materials (cotton, silk, leather) match attributes.  
4. Detect exaggerated performance or medical statements.  
5. Provide safe rephrasing alternatives.  
6. Cite sections when explaining violations.  

This ensures the copilot gives clear, policy-backed compliance feedback.
