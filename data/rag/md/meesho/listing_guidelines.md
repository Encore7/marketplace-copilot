# 1. Overview of Meesho Listing Philosophy

Meesho prioritizes:

- **Clear product representation**  
- **Accurate material and size details**  
- **High-quality images**  
- **No promotional claims**  
- **Avoiding misleading content**

2. Generate clean, factual bullets  
3. Improve attribute completeness  
4. Remove promotional/competitive terms  
5. Flag inconsistent patterns or materials  
6. Suggest corrections aligned with unbranded fashion norms  
7. Detect misleading size chart or material descriptions  

This ensures listing quality and compliance with Meesho guidelines.
